description: Run at the beginning of every work session. Loads context, checks for conflicts, shows priorities and overdue actions. Ensures you start every session oriented and ready to work.

# Session Start

**Run this at the start of every session** — it orients you to the current project state and prevents duplicate or conflicting work.

---

## Step 0 — Get Current Date

```bash
date +%Y-%m-%d
```

Record this as the session date.

## Step 1 — Check for Conflicts

Read `STATUS.md`. Check the "In Progress" table:
- If another agent has items in progress → flag to the user which workstreams are active
- If the user's intended work overlaps with an in-progress item → warn before proceeding

## Step 2 — Determine Context Loading Mode

Ask the user: **"What are you working on this session?"**

Map their answer to a loading mode:

| Task type | Mode | Load |
|-----------|------|------|
| Pipeline updates, outreach, scheduling, call prep | **Fast** | `context/pipeline-state.md` only |
| Research, competitor analysis, entity enrichment | **Standard** | `context/competitor-snapshot.md` + `context/market-snapshot.md` |
| Discovery call prep, hypothesis work, strategic review | **Standard** | `context/project-state.md` |
| Hypothesis review, critical reasoning, kill condition updates, strategic decisions | **Deep** | `context/project-state.md` → then ALL raw evidence files |
| Housekeeping, maintenance | **Fast** | `context/project-state.md` |

Tell the user which mode you're using and why.

## Step 3 — Load Context Snapshot(s)

Read the appropriate context snapshot(s) based on Step 2.

For **Deep** mode: read the snapshot first for orientation, then read:
- All files in `discovery/calls/`
- `memory/decisions.md`
- `memory/research.md`

## Step 4 — Show Current Priorities

Read `memory/MEMORY.md`. Report to the user:
- **Current phase** and project state
- **Current priority** (the 1–2 items flagged as most important)
- **Kill condition status** — any conditions that are FAILING or changed recently

## Step 5 — Check for Overdue Actions

If the discovery module is active, scan `memory/discovery.md` Outreach Log and `context/pipeline-state.md` for:
- Next actions with dates in the past
- Entities in "Meeting booked" status with no follow-up
- Entities in "Contacted" status for more than 7 days with no response

Report any overdue items to the user.

### Step 5.5 — Surface Seed TODOs

Scan `memory/MEMORY.md` for a `## Seed TODOs` section. If present and contains any unchecked `- [ ]` items, surface them at the top of the session briefing as "Seed TODOs (from onboard)".

These are items the user skipped during `/onboard` — things like "Add your first entity", "Write an initial working hypothesis", "Paste any existing research". They don't block work but they're easy wins that compound over time.

Don't nag every session — just list them once per session briefing. The user can mark them complete (`- [x]`) or leave them indefinitely.

## Step 6 — Report Time Since Last Session

Read `docs/output/work-log.md`. Find the most recent entry date. Calculate and report how many days since the last session.

If > 7 days: suggest running `/rebuild-snapshots` to ensure context is fresh.

## Step 7 — Register in STATUS.md

Add the user's intended work to the "In Progress" table in `STATUS.md`:
- Workstream: based on task type
- Item: brief description of planned work
- Owner: user's name (from `memory/MEMORY.md` Team field)
- Date: today's date

## Step 8 — Session Briefing

Provide a concise briefing:

> **Session briefing — {date}**
> - **Mode**: {Fast/Standard/Deep}
> - **Focus**: {what the user said they're working on}
> - **Priority**: {from MEMORY.md}
> - **Overdue**: {count of overdue items, or "none"}
> - **Days since last session**: {N}
> - **Conflicts**: {none, or list}

Then: "Ready to start. What's first?"
