## Context Loading

Load the snapshot for your task type. **Do not read raw source files unless the snapshot is insufficient for your task.**

| Task | Load first |
|------|-----------|
| Discovery call prep, hypothesis work, strategic review | `context/project-state.md` |
| Pipeline updates, outreach, call scheduling | `context/pipeline-state.md` |
| Competitor or market research | `context/competitor-snapshot.md` + `context/market-snapshot.md` |
| Housekeeping | `context/project-state.md` (verify what changed this session) |

### Three Loading Modes

| Mode | When | Rule |
|------|------|------|
| **Fast** | Pipeline updates, housekeeping, scheduling, call prep | Snapshot only |
| **Standard** | Research, competitor analysis, entity enrichment | Snapshot + targeted raw files as needed |
| **Deep** | Hypothesis review, critical reasoning, kill condition updates, strategic decisions | Load snapshot for orientation — then read ALL raw evidence before forming any view |

**Deep mode rule**: Snapshots tell you what was concluded; raw files contain disconfirming signals, hedged language, and contradictions that drive good reasoning. For hypothesis-class work, reading only snapshots is not acceptable.

Raw evidence sources for Deep mode:
- All files in `discovery/calls/` — every call note
- `memory/decisions.md` — full decision log with rationale
- `memory/research.md` — capability map and market findings

## Multi-Agent Coordination

### Before Starting
1. Read `STATUS.md` — check for conflicts.
2. Add yourself to "In Progress" with workstream, item, date.
3. Use templates from `templates/`.

### While Working
- One file per unit of work.
- Research → `research/`. Discovery → `discovery/`. Docs → `docs/`.
- Never overwrite another agent's in-progress file without reading it first.

### Pipeline Work
Dashboard source of truth: `{{PIPELINE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH}}` — add {{ENTITY_TYPE_PLURAL}} here first, never only to JSON.

### After Completing Work
1. Move STATUS.md row to "Completed Recently".
2. Update the relevant `context/` snapshot — keep it current for the next session.
3. If work changes hypothesis or kill conditions → run `/critical-reasoning` before updating `docs/executive-summary.md`.

### Executive Summary Rule
`docs/executive-summary.md` is the single source of truth. Update after: every discovery call, kill condition changes, major research, strategic decisions.

### Agent Briefing Format
Task → Constraints → 3–5 key facts (with file paths, not content) → output spec → model weight. No file content dumps.

## Model Routing

Default: Opus. Switch to Sonnet for mechanical/template work (`/model sonnet`).

Opus required: hypothesis review, discovery call processing, critical reasoning, strategic decisions.
Sonnet fine: competitor research, call prep, housekeeping, dashboard/data work.

---

## End-of-Session Housekeeping (MANDATORY)

Run `/housekeeping`. Full checklist: `docs/memos/housekeeping-reference.md`.

After any session that changes discovery, pipeline, or decisions — regenerate the affected `context/` snapshot before committing.

Evidence grading rules: `docs/memos/evidence-grading.md`

## Relevant User-Level Skills

<!-- These skills live at ~/.claude/skills/ and are available across all projects.
     Add project-specific context sections to them if needed. -->

- `/bottom-up-tam`, `/micro-segmentation` — market sizing
- `/critical-reasoning` — hypothesis stress-testing (user-level version has additional vertical SaaS lens; project-level version is domain-agnostic)
- `/strategic-framework-synthesiser` — structured analysis (Porter's, PESTLE, BCG, etc.)
- `/gtm-playbook` — go-to-market planning
- `/outside-in-benchmarking` — competitive analysis
- `/pricing-packaging` — monetisation design
- `/unit-economics-modeler` — CAC, LTV, payback period
- `/burning-platform` — change management narratives
- `/macro-trend-synthesis` — PESTLE+ trend analysis
- `/partnership-ecosystem-strategy` — partner program design
- `/product-roadmap-prioritisation` — backlog prioritisation
- `/profit-pool-mapping` — value chain analysis
