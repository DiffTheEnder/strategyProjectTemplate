# Getting Started — Your First Strategy Project

This guide walks you through everything from scratch. No coding experience needed.

---

## What Is This?

This is a **strategy project template** — a pre-built workspace that helps you run strategy projects (like market research, competitive analysis, or deciding whether to enter a new market).

It works with **Claude Code**, an AI assistant that lives in your terminal (the text-based interface on your computer). You talk to Claude, and it helps you:
- Organise your research into structured files
- Track prospects and competitors
- Make evidence-based decisions
- Generate a live dashboard showing your project's progress

Think of it like a strategy consulting toolkit that an AI helps you run.

## What You'll Need

Before starting, you'll need three things installed on your computer:

1. **Git** — a tool for downloading and tracking changes to projects
2. **Node.js** — a tool that powers the dashboard (you won't need to write code)
3. **Claude Code** — the AI assistant that runs the project

Don't worry if you don't have these yet — we'll install them step by step.

---

## Step 1: Install Git

### On Mac
1. Open **Terminal** (press Cmd + Space, type "Terminal", press Enter)
2. Type `git --version` and press Enter
3. If Git isn't installed, your Mac will prompt you to install it — follow the prompts
4. If it shows a version number (like `git version 2.39.0`), you're good

### On Windows
1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Download and run the installer
3. Accept all the default settings
4. Open **Command Prompt** (press Win + R, type "cmd", press Enter)
5. Type `git --version` to confirm it's installed

---

## Step 2: Install Node.js

1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download the **LTS** version (the one that says "Recommended for most users")
3. Run the installer and accept all defaults
4. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
5. Type `node --version` — you should see something like `v18.17.0`

---

## Step 3: Install Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's AI assistant for your terminal.

1. Go to https://claude.ai/code and follow the installation instructions for your platform
2. Once installed, type `claude` in your terminal to verify it works
3. You'll need an Anthropic account — create one if you don't have one

---

## Step 4: Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)

GitHub is where your project lives online. You'll need it for:
- Storing your project
- Deploying your dashboard (optional)
- Collaborating with others (optional)

1. Go to https://github.com and click "Sign up"
2. Follow the prompts to create your account
3. Choose the free plan — it has everything you need

---

## Step 5: Get the Template

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to where you want your project (e.g., `cd ~/Documents`)
3. Run this command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DiffTheEnder/strategyProjectTemplate.git my-strategy-project
   ```
   (Replace `my-strategy-project` with whatever you want to call your folder)
4. Move into the folder:
   ```
   cd my-strategy-project
   ```

---

## Step 6: Set Up Your Project

1. In your terminal (inside the project folder), start Claude:
   ```
   claude
   ```
2. Tell Claude to run the setup:
   ```
   /onboard
   ```
3. Claude will ask you questions about your project:
   - **Quick Start** (5 minutes): Just the basics — project name, what it's about, your hypothesis
   - **Full Setup** (15 minutes): Everything including scoring dimensions, kill conditions, and feature selection

4. Claude will ask what type of project you're running — market entry, growth strategy, competitor research, product launch, internal implementation, vendor evaluation, due diligence, business case, transformation, or custom. Each type comes with sensible defaults for which features to enable.

5. Claude will configure all the files based on your answers

**Tip**: If you're new to this, choose **Quick Start** and select **"Learning"** as your goal. Claude will point you to the example project so you can explore first.

## Step 7: Deploy Your Dashboard (Optional)

Your project includes a live dashboard that shows your research, pipeline, and strategic progress as a website. Here's how to put it online:

### Create a Vercel Account
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "Sign Up" and choose "Continue with GitHub"
3. Authorise Vercel to access your GitHub account

### Push Your Project to GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new to create a new repository
2. Name it (e.g., `my-strategy-project`)
3. Choose **Private** (your strategy data should stay confidential)
4. Don't add a README (you already have one)
5. Follow the "push an existing repository" instructions GitHub shows you:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-strategy-project.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Connect to Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Click "Import Git Repository"
3. Select your strategy project repository
4. **Important**: Set the **Root Directory** to `dashboard`
5. Vercel will auto-detect the build settings from `vercel.json`
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Wait 1-2 minutes — your dashboard will be live at a `.vercel.app` URL

### Auto-Deploy
Every time you push changes to GitHub (which `/session-end` does automatically), Vercel will rebuild and update your dashboard. No extra steps needed.

### Privacy Warning
**Your dashboard will be publicly accessible** at the Vercel URL unless you:
- Use Vercel's password protection (requires a paid plan)
- Keep the URL private and don't share it
- Use a private GitHub repo (the code is private, but the deployed site is still accessible to anyone with the URL)

For sensitive strategy work, consider whether a live dashboard is appropriate for your situation.

## Step 8: Start Working

Every time you sit down to work on your project:

1. Open Terminal, navigate to your project folder
2. Start Claude: `claude`
3. Tell Claude: `/session-start`
4. Claude will load your context and show you what's happening

When you're done:
1. Tell Claude: `/session-end`
2. Claude will save everything, update the dashboard, and commit your changes

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
No. You talk to Claude in plain English. The only "commands" you need are the skill names (like `/onboard` or `/session-start`).

**Q: Can I use this for personal projects?**
Yes. It works for any project where you're making strategic decisions based on research — from choosing a business idea to evaluating job offers.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**
Everything is tracked in Git (version control). You can always go back to a previous state. Ask Claude: "Can you undo the last change?"

**Q: Can multiple people work on the same project?**
Yes. The STATUS.md file coordinates who's working on what. Each person runs Claude Code in their own terminal.

**Q: How do I update to the latest template version?**
Check the CHANGELOG.md in the original repository for what's new. For major updates, it's often easiest to start fresh and re-run `/onboard`.

**Q: Is my data private?**
Your project files live on your computer and (optionally) in your private GitHub repository. If you deploy a dashboard to Vercel, the dashboard URL is accessible to anyone who has it. Don't put confidential information in the dashboard if you're concerned about privacy.
